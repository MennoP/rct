# Contributing

We welcome new contributors! Here is a guide to getting started.

1. Check [the README][readme] - It has useful information about installing the
project, running tests, adding new coasters, what's been done and what needs to
get done.

2. At this point I'm more excited to have people excited about the project than
worries about code style. There is [a test suite up on Travis][travis]. I've
found especially with the track data and directional stuff that adding tests
can help enforce correctness, but I don't care too much.

3. Ask questions! I will literally drop anything I am working on to help you
understand what's going on in the code base and help you to get started with
this project. Contact me at [kev@inburke.com][mailto] or open
an issue here.

4. Not super familiar with Git or pull requests or whatever? Don't worry - just
change the code and email me and I'll help you contribute a patch.
